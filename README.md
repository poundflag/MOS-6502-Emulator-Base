# MOS-6502-Emulator-Base
## A C++ implementation of the MOS-6502 processor

The MOS-6502-Emulator-Base is an emulator, which is intended to be as modular as possible, to be used in a variety of systems (f.e. KIM-1).

### Milestones

- [X] Passing self-made unit tests
- [X] Passing the [diagnostic test made by Frank A. Kingswood](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests/blob/master/bin_files/6502_functional_test.lst)
- [ ] Update the diagrams
- [ ] Create a Wiki-Page for the project

### TODO 
- Create a KIM-1 Project based on this
